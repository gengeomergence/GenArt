# GenArt
Various Artistic Processing Sketches

note: these sketches use the Python language version of Processing

New to Processing, and to generative art in general. Here I will keep all of my favorite sketches.
I try to make each sketch file as readable as possible, with values you can edit up at the begining, but feel free to message me
with questions!

DESCRIPTIONS OF FILES:

PerlinBrushStroke:
  basically rotational perlin noise. Spend some time messing with the settings, there are so many different results that can come from this 
  simple code

noiseObject:
  this sketch uses bezier curves and perlin noise to generate symmetrical objects with bezier curves shooting out, not really sure how
  to explain it, best to experiment with it

SeaCreatures:
  generate perlin noise shapes that resemble life, specifically alien ocean life. Designed to look like infrared images taken from 
  an ocean world somewhere in the cosmos. Almost completely generative

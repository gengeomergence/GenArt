# GenArt
Various Artistic Processing Sketches

*note: these sketches use the Python language version of Processing*

New to Processing, and to generative art in general. Here I will keep all of my favorite sketches.
I try to make each sketch file as readable as possible, with values you can edit up at the begining, but feel free to message me
with questions!

DESCRIPTIONS OF FILES:

## [Custom Pseudo Noise Donuts](Custom_PSEUDO_noise)

## [SeaCreature:](SeaCreature.pyde)
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/gengeomergence/Images/blob/master/SeaCreatureE.png" width="90%"></p>

  > Generate perlin noise shapes that resemble life, specifically alien ocean life. 
  > Designed to look like infrared images taken from an ocean world somewhere in the cosmos.

## [PerlinBrushStroke:](PerlinBrushStroke.pyde)
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/gengeomergence/Images/blob/master/perlinStroke.png" width="90%"></p>

  > Basically rotational perlin noise. Spend some time messing with the settings, 
  > there are so many different results that can come from this simple code
  
## [Sin, Tan, and Perlin:](SinTanPerlinExperiment.pyde)
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/gengeomergence/Images/blob/master/SandScape.png" width="90%"></p>

  > Another very simple code that has many different results, depending on the settings. 
  > Generates interesting forms with a characteristic falling sand effect

## [noiseObject:](noiseObject.pyde)
  > This sketch uses bezier curves and perlin noise to generate symmetrical objects with bezier curves shooting out, 
  > not really sure how to explain it, best to experiment with it
